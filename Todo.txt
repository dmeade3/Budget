Program:

    [ ] make account selector pane work
    [ ] make budget tab use the current transactions to fill out data work



    [ ] no user categories right now
        -addbudgetsection should be able to pick from enums not already being used
    [ ] make RefreshGui a class of its own if possible
    [ ] in summary all should show the order of the accounts and when they were last updated, oldest since update should be in the top
    [ ] should have a function to find gaps in the account dates
    [ ] when loading have the wholde screan show a loading screan so you know its not just frozen

    [ ] editors should be dialogs not stages
        -all
    [ ] eventually have option to add user categories
    [ ] sort all comboboxes
    [ ] dont bring up login popup if no password set
        -set password in some kind of admin preferences page
        -needs to be a way to set password
            -type in old password, then new

    [ ] make in main program data a list of account that are selected on the tree, will be destroyed and filled after every account tree change
    [ ] when opening a data csv file if it doesnt exist then create a new one
        -maybe create all new csv files on user creation, include the headers

    -delete should bring up a separate gui ask are you sure?
    -when transactions read in they need to have info added to them
        -category empty unless previous mapping exists

    -budget tab a budget for the whole user not just a single account
    -input rules on all text fields / try catches and error messages
        -this really means test stupid inputs and make sure the program doesnt let it go through / breaks
    -make user password protected as an option
        -make users read into an array or user objects and mapped to a password / if pass blank then no password
        -encrypt the passwords
            -this is going to be its own thing here
            -encrypt decrypt package

    -test with completely blank user and make sure doesnt fail
    -be able to add budget sections
    -be able to add transactions
    -be able to add accounts

    General Practices:
        -All system.out.println() -> logger
        -larger classes should be split up into smaller classes
        -Complete TODO's

    Summary Tab:
        -graphs as part of it, should also have a pane of non labeled data
        -give breakdown of where money is being spent as well
            -pie graph of accounts

    Future tab:
        -help predict future financial status

    User:
        -user has associated mapping of vendors to categories

        Budget: will have to make this object and store it in the user
            -list of budget sections
            -total budgeted
            -only need a getter because it should be calculated for each call
            -total spent

        Account:
            -balance should be stored in the accounts csv file and updated every time there is a change to it

        TransactionParser:
            -parser interface that all parsers have to implement

            Switch statement to what kind of data it is:
                csv:

                other...:
                    -find these file formats

    -known vendors list
        -mapped to a specific category to help along with the category matching
        -learns over time as you set more rules
        -is saved and read in each time
            -EX   Walmart:->:groceries
                :->: as the mapping symbol

    -store balance info
        -admin section to set current balance when first setting up program

    Functionality:
        -take transactions from mint
        -investment tracking
            -maybe make a tab of just have it as part of the summary
        -should say when account was last updated in summary tab
            -will need to add this to the account csv
            -make file find and replace util
                -make very general csv find and replace for whole rows / individual items

        -when asking about where the csv came from, ask about accounts or bank, account should have mapping of csv in it
        -when account clicked on it should update the middle scrollpane with that account info
        -eventually make transaction editor datepicker limited to today and back as available dates
        -eventually take out all the creation dates
            -if ever going public with this will need to wipe all date info on it
            -github has the dates too
                -would need to delete the repo and remake it with files with fresh dates
